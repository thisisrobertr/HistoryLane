To-do list for histvisweb (continuation of historylane, and will be its version 2.0 - more rightly, its 1.0):

1. Modify "threshold" attribute to add to a dedicated "everything else" category rather than just ignoring data - DONE, 3/13/24
2. With the data thereby cleaned up, retool the graphs to look better and serve as a more useful distillation of browsing habits
3. Add an Obsidian Notes-style scatterplot with each visit as a point in a site's particular orbit.
4. Add a GUI enabling the user to manipulate the visualization/data.
5. Retool the Vivaldi and Firefox scrapers' class structure to be more conducive to inheritance.
6. Add support for constellations of related browser (Chrome variants, Firefox Developer Edition, etc. etc.)
7. Add a feature to export CSV/JSON of browser history
